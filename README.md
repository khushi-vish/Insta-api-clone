# Instagram API Clone

This project is an Instagram API clone built using Node.js and Express. It provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations for posts and profiles, although data is currently stored in-memory using arrays.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to build APIs and web apps.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
  
## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for posts and profiles.
- **RESTful API**: Designed according to REST principles, utilizing HTTP methods like GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
- **Temporary Data Storage**: Uses arrays to store data temporarily; future plans include integrating a database for persistent storage.

## Usage
To run the project locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `node index.js` or `npm start`.
4. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or directly through frontend applications.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for persistent data storage.
- Improve frontend interface with more polished HTML/CSS templates.
- Implement authentication and user management features.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
